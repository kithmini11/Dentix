# Dentix - Revolutionizing Orthodontic Care

Welcome to Dentix, a web application built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to revolutionize orthodontic care in Sri Lanka. Dentix connects doctors, patients, and suppliers on a single platform, making orthodontic supplies accessible while supporting low-income patients through an innovative loyalty points system.

## About Dentix

Dentix is designed to streamline orthodontic supply management for Sri Lankan government hospitals. Key features include:

- **Simplified Ordering**: Patients can order supplies via WhatsApp, SMS, or the web platform with ease.
- **Loyalty Points System**: Hospitals earn points with every purchase, redeemable to support low-income patients.
- **Community Support**: Facilitates donations to ensure quality dental care for all.
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Separate dashboards for doctors, patients, suppliers, hospitals, and admins to manage their tasks efficiently.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience across devices.

This project leverages React for a dynamic user interface, integrated with a robust backend to manage user roles and provide a seamless experience. The homepage offers a welcoming interface with sections for features, a call to action, and a footer with quick links and language options.

## Getting Started

To get started with Dentix, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dentix.git
   cd dentix
Install dependencies:
bash

Copy
npm install
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view Dentix in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

You may also see lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except eject will still work, pointing to the copied scripts for customization. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature.
